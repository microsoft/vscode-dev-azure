# Bug Bash

> Note: You will need to have an active Azure subscription that has been uploaded to AFEC by the team. Please reach out to @meharida
> to send in your azure sub and get access to this product.

## Entry points to vscode.dev/azure 

> 1. Visit [https://insiders.vscode.dev/azure] directly to start using the product from scratch.
> 2. If you would like to start with a template, please visit [https://thankful-tree-067d73a10.5.azurestaticapps.net/]. You can click on 'Try Template' to launch into vscode.dev/azure

## Using 

> 1. /azure will connect you to an Azure Cloudshell instance and you should be ready to go automatically.
> 2. You can run, debug and deploy applications on /azure within the environment

## Limitations

> 1. Docker is not compatible. Any template or project that relies on docker will not work at the moment.
> 2. Work is not saved. For this private preview, there is no storage account attached to your work, hence, when you quit the session, your work will not be saved.
> 3. A small lag in loading time at the beginning is expected - please check whether there is a pop-up from VSCode asking you to sign in with Microsoft or GitHub.

# Getting Help & Providing Feedback

Happy to help with any and all questions!
