# VS Code for the Web - Azure

VS Code for the Web - Azure is an Azure-specific environment for VS Code for Web that leverages Azure Cloud Shell.

In a nutshell, it's VS Code running from within your Azure Cloud Shell. You can run, debug and deploy Azure applications from the browser. Common Azure tools such as the Azure CLI, Python, and azd are pre-installed.

## How do I get access to the product? 

You will need to have an active Azure subscription that has our feature flag added to it. Please fill out the form at this link to request access: https://aka.ms/VSCodefortheWebAzure

## Using

There are two main ways to use VS Code for the Web - Azure. Either start with an azd template, or start from scratch with an empty workspace.

### azd template

[What is azd?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/)

If you would like to start with an azd template, please visit [our preview version of the awesome-azd website](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-azd-templates). You can click on 'Try Template' to launch into vscode.dev/azure. The selected azd template will be automatically initialized in your VS Code for the Web - Azure workspace. You can run `azd up` in the terminal to deploy the template to Azure.

### Starting from scratch

You can also use VS Code for the Web - Azure without using an azd template. This will open a blank workspace. To do this, go directly to https://insiders.vscode.dev/azure.

### Logging in

Whether coming from a template, or starting from scratch, once you reach https://insiders.vscode.dev/azure, you'll be prompted to login with your Azure account. Select "Allow". Make sure to sign in with the account that contains the subscription you provided when signing up.

If your account belongs to more than one tenant, you'll be asked to select one. Make sure to select the tenant that contains the subscription you provided when signing up.

After signing in and selecting a tenant (if required), you'll start connecting to an Azure Cloud Shell instance. If at this point you see an error saying "Access denied. Account and tenant don't contain an allowed subscription." it means you haven't been granted access to the private preview. If you see this error and believe it's a mistake, please file an issue and label it as a product access bug.

## Known Issues and Limitations  

1. Azure Cloud Shell instances that vscode.dev/azure connect to use Ehpemeral storage. This means changes to the filesystem arenâ€™t expected to persist between different vscode.dev/azure sessions.
2. A long initial loading time is expected.

## Filing Issues 

Please create issues on this repository as you find them while using vscode.dev/azure. The more detail the better. If possible, please include logs from the "VS Code for the Web - Azure" output channel.
